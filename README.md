# MOBILE APP TESTING PROJECT - QUERYCARD SHOP

## Welcome to our MobileTest project!

### Important Rules:
**1. Never Push from Main:** It's crucial to maintain the stability of our main branch. All changes should be made through feature branches and merged via pull requests after thorough review.

**2. Branch Policy:** Each team member must create a new branch for their work. Name your branch according to your name or the feature you're working on.

**3. Hourly Backup System:** Our project implements an hourly backup system. The main branch is remotely backed up to containers, ensuring data safety. 

**4. Framework Structure:** Please adhere to the framework's structure for organizing classes, hooks, step definitions, and methods. Consistency in structure simplifies collaboration and maintenance.

**5. Conflict Resolution:** Every team member is responsible for resolving their own conflicts. Communication is key; reach out for assistance if needed, but strive to resolve conflicts independently.
